### 5. Verify Photos Are Added

Run this command to check:
```bash
cd "/home/appiah/Documents/projects/Icon For Change/icon_for_change_website/public/images/schools/kontoh/"
ls -lh
```

```
main.jpg
building.jpg
students.jpg
classroom.jpg
playground.jpg
library.jpg
activities.jpg
README.md
.gitkeep
```

---

### 6. Test the Website

**Start Development Server:**
```bash
cd "/home/appiah/Documents/projects/Icon For Change/icon_for_change_website"
npm run dev
```

**Open Browser:**
- Home page: http://localhost:5173
- Schools page: http://localhost:5173/schools

**Check:**
- Scroll down home page to "Our School" section - main.jpg should appear
- Click "Schools" in navigation or "Learn More" button
- All 7 photos should display on the schools page

---

### 7. If Images Don't Show

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Photos are in correct folder: `/public/images/schools/kontoh/`
- [ ] File names are EXACTLY: main.jpg, building.jpg, students.jpg, etc. (lowercase, .jpg extension)
- [ ] Photos are JPG/JPEG format (not PNG, not .JPG with uppercase)
- [ ] Photos are not corrupted (can open them in image viewer)
- [ ] Cleared browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- [ ] Development server is running

**Still not working?**
The website has fallback images, so it won't break. But to fix:
1. Check file names match EXACTLY (Linux is case-sensitive!)
2. Try renaming: `mv Main.jpg main.jpg` (if accidentally uppercase)
3. Check file permissions: `chmod 644 *.jpg`

cd "/home/appiah/Documents/projects/Icon For Change/icon_for_change_website/public/images/schools/kontoh/"

# 2. Copy and rename your photos
cp ~/Desktop/Kontoh_Photos/IMG001.jpg ./main.jpg

## Privacy Reminder

Before uploading photos with students:
- âœ… Obtain written consent from parents/guardians
- âœ… Consider blurring faces if you don't have consent forms
- âœ… Avoid capturing names, addresses, or personal info
- âœ… Focus on activities and the learning environment

## Quick Tips

### Optimizing Large Photos:
If your photos are too large (over 2MB), compress them:

**Online Tools:**
- https://tinyjpg.com
- https://squoosh.app
- https://compressor.io

**Linux Command Line:**
```bash
# Install imagemagick if not installed
sudo apt install imagemagick

# Resize and compress a photo
convert input.jpg -resize 1920x1080 -quality 85 output.jpg
```

### Taking Good School Photos:
- **Lighting**: Natural light works best - take photos during daytime
- **Angle**: Capture wide shots showing the full building/area
- **Focus**: Ensure photos aren't blurry
- **Composition**: Show activity and engagement, not just empty rooms
- **Variety**: Mix of indoor/outdoor, students/facilities, learning/playing

## What Happens Next?

Once photos are added:
1. **Home Page** will display main.jpg in the "Our School" featured section
2. **Schools Page** (`/schools`) will show a beautiful gallery with all 7 photos
3. Visitors can click "Learn More" to see full school details
4. Visitors can click "Support the School" to donate

3. Ensure photos meet requirements (JPG, under 2MB, good quality)
4. Try clearing browser cache
5. Restart development server
